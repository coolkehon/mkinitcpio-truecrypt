To use this mkinicpio hook for truecrypt add
truecrypt to the mkinitcpio hooks in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf then
add tcdevice=<device>:<slotnum> to your kernel boot command line args
if you use grub check /boot/grub/menu.lst of /boot/grub/grub.cfg
The root device of a truecrypt encrypted device will be /dev/mapper/truecrypt<slotnum>
where as you may have guessed <slotnum> is the number given in tcdevice=<device>:<slotnum>
this works similar to how cryptluks works
